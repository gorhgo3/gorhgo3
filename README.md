# Hello world, I'm Murray! 👋🌏

## About Me
As a full-stack software developer with a knack for Python and web development, my journey in coding goes beyond scripting to building dynamic, reactive web applications. I've embraced the challenge of learning JavaScript and React, complementing my server-side expertise with client-side rendering skills.

## My Tech Journey
- **Python Foundations**: Began with Python, scripting, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- **Diving into Full-Stack**: Expanded my skills across the full stack, focusing on the MERN stack and developing a comprehensive understanding of both client and server-side technologies.
- **Exploring Reactivity**: Ventured into reactive web pages, honing my skills in JavaScript fundamentals and React-based applications.
- **Database Proficiency**: Experienced in working with an array of databases, including SQL with Python and JavaScript, Google Firebase, Firestore, and a foundational understanding of MongoDB.

## Bootcamp and Beyond
- **Bootcamp Breakthrough**: Attended a boot camp in September 2023, where I solidified my understanding of Git, GitHub, and collaborative development (representing delayed projects added at this time).
- **Continuous Evolution**: Regularly revisiting and refining early projects, demonstrating my ongoing learning and adaptation in technology.

## Current Focus and Aspirations
- **Open to Opportunities**: Actively seeking roles that allow me to further explore web development, particularly in areas combining server-side logic with dynamic front-end frameworks.
- **Passionate Collaboration**: Eager to join forces with other developers, contribute to impactful projects, and share knowledge within the community.
- **Community Contribution**: Committed to helping others on their coding journey, drawing from my diverse experiences across different technologies.

## Pre-September 2023 
- **Various Python coding projects**: I engaged in various projects. Scripting and Server-side Rendering web pages. Before engaging with the Bootcamp through Dev Academy I hadn't delved into Git and Github. Which represents this lack of projects displayed
- **December 2023**: Working to get many previous projects uplaoded and stored to Github Repositories. Currently in the process of tidying up my profile to represent those previous projects ⏳
